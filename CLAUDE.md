# AI Assistant Instructions

## Critical Git Workflow Rules

⚠️ **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL AI ASSISTANTS**: 

**NEVER perform ANY Git operations without explicit user permission.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- ❌ `git commit`
- ❌ `git push`
- ❌ `git pull`
- ❌ `git fetch`
- ❌ `git rebase`
- ❌ `git merge`
- ❌ `git branch -d` (delete)
- ❌ `git checkout` (switching branches)
- ❌ `git reset`
- ❌ `git stash`
- ❌ Creating pull requests
- ❌ Closing pull requests
- ❌ Deleting branches (local or remote)
- ❌ ANY other Git or GitHub operations

## Workflow

1. Make code changes ONLY when requested by the user
2. Show the user what changes were made
3. **WAIT for explicit instruction** before doing ANY git operations
4. The user will tell you exactly when to commit, push, or perform any Git actions
5. ASK for permission if you think a Git operation might be needed

## Current Branch

Stay on `genspark-updates-v2` branch unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the user.

## Important Notes

- The user maintains **FULL CONTROL** over version control operations
- Your role is to write code and make changes, NOT to manage Git
- Always assume NO permission unless explicitly granted
- When in doubt, ASK the user before doing anything with Git

---

**Remember**: User permission is REQUIRED for every single Git operation.
