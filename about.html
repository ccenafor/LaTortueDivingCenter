  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <div class="about-split">
    <div style="display:grid;gap:1rem;">
      <p class="muted">What started as a vision for Marielle and Nicolas to live by the sea and share their passions with travelers from all over the world, came to fruition in February of 2020. Marielle had left her life in Manila and her corporate job to start anew with Nicolas, who had been reinventing his life too after leaving France. Dauin, Negros Oriental felt like the ideal place to build a modest first venture together. The name "La Tortue" means The Turtle in French, and it was originally meant to attract the French-speaking market that Nicolas could teach diving. Neither of them knew that the global pandemic would change the course of their life and business altogether.</p>
      <p class="muted">La Tortue became a metaphor for the months that followed - as everything moved in a much slower pace, albeit steady, calm, and hopeful. People embraced more and more not only the love for nature and diving, but the chill island lifestyle altogether. La Tortue offers modest but comfortable rooms a few steps away from the sea, freshly prepared food and drinks made from local ingredients, and activities centered on appreciation for nature.</p>
      <p class="muted">La Tortue Diving Center & Beach Resort is a safe haven for nature-lovers, explorers, foodies, and everything in between! We are happy to welcome you on your next adventure!</p>
